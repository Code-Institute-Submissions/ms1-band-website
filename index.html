						DJ Shadow, a.k.a. Josh Davis, could be credited with bringing newfound introspection
						to the gloating sounds of hip-hop. Condensed with urban oscillations and scatological
						beats, Endtroducing shutters with eclectic samples and aural montages that reach beyond
						the constraints of hip-hop style. Enhancing the mix with fundamentals of rock, soul,
						funk, ambient, and jazz, the modern fusions fail to go unnoticed, even by the casual
						listener. While most of the tracks are compiled by layering samples from vinyl treasures
						found in used-record bins, the production quality of the mosaic is unmatched. Darkened
						melodies carry throughout the album with its eye on the end of the tunnel. The narration
						samples come from numerous sources and keep the listener involved and waiting for
						resolution. With a message as fragmentary as an overheard conversation, Endtroducing
						conveys no apparent conclusion, but begs the mind, body, and soul for some rewind. --Lucas
						Hilbert
